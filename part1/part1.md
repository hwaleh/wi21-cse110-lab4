Question 1: The value of 'i' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q2: The value of 'discountedPrice' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q3: The value of 'finalPrice' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q4: It will return an array containing [50,100,150]. This is because the for loop applies the discount (0.5) to all values in prices and places those values in discounted, which is returned.

Q5: There will be an error since 'i' is declared in the for loop with 'let'.

Q6: There will be an error since 'discountedPrice' is declared in the for loop with 'let'.

Q7: The value of 'finalPrice' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q8: Assuming it compiles and runs, it will return an array containing [50,100,150]. This is because the for loop applies the discount (0.5) to all values in prices and places those values in discounted, which is returned.

Q9: There will be an error since 'i' is declared in the for loop with 'let'.

Q10: There will be an error because 'discountedPrice' is declared as 'const' but is modified.

Q11: There will be an error because 'finalPrice' is declared as 'const' but is modified. 

Q12: Assuming it compiles and runs, it will return an array containing [50,100,150]. This is because the for loop applies the discount (0.5) to all values in prices and places those values in discounted, which is returned.
