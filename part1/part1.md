Question 1: The value of 'i' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q2: The value of 'discountedPrice' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q3: The value of 'finalPrice' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q4: It will return an array containing [50,100,150]. This is because the for loop applies the discount (0.5) to all values in prices and places those values in discounted, which is returned.

Q5: There will be an error since 'i' is declared in the for loop with 'let'.

Q6: There will be an error since 'discountedPrice' is declared in the for loop with 'let'.

Q7: The value of 'finalPrice' will be printed since it is declared with var.

Q8: Assuming it compiles and runs, it will return an array containing [50,100,150]. This is because the for loop applies the discount (0.5) to all values in prices and places those values in discounted, which is returned.

Q9: There will be an error since 'i' is declared in the for loop with 'let'.

Q10: There will be an error because 'discountedPrice' is declared as 'const' but is modified.

Q11: There will be an error because 'finalPrice' is declared as 'const' but is modified. 

Q12: Assuming it compiles and runs, it will return an array containing [50,100,150]. This is because the for loop applies the discount (0.5) to all values in prices and places those values in discounted, which is returned.

Q13:
- a: alert(student.name)
- b: alert(student["Grad Year"])
- c: student.greeting()
- d: alert(student["Favorite Teacher"].name)
- e: alert(student.courseLoad[0])

Q14: 
- a: '32'. The numeric 2 is converted to a string/ char and concatenated to the 3.
- b: 1. The char/ string 3 is converted to a number and arithmetic occurs since - doesn't have a string equivalent.
- c: 3. Since null converts to 0, simple addition occurs.
- d: '3null'. String concatenation occurs because null converts to a string.
- e: 4. true converts to 1, so simple addition occurs.
- f: 0. Since neither operand is a string, simple addition occurs. false=0 and null=0.
- g: 3undefined. Since 3 is a string and addition is occuring, the operands are concatenated.
- h: NaN. Similar to part b, arithmetic occurs. Since undefined=NaN, any arithmetic with undefined=NaN.
